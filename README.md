# UFOs Challenge

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this Analysis was to create a webpage using the data from the UFO sightings. Filters were applied to allow for searching based on date, city, state, country, and shape criteria. The application's used in this project were HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, VSC, and Jupyter.

Here is a preview of the webpage.

## Results:
In order to get the results, enter any of the criteria for the date, location, and shape in the field provided on the left. Just hit enter after filling in any of the options and it will populate the information to the right. The data is limited so it will only show so much within the range the data.js file gave us.

## Summary:
- The drawback is that the search criteria is case-sensitive and you have to be specific.
- Improvement's that can be made are to add an additional filter for duration of sightings.
- Another improvement that could enhance the webpage, adding a map distribution of the results so we can see which states or cities have more sightings than others.
